# Manage FHIR resources using FHIR Engine Library

## Before you begin

### What you'll build

In this codelab, you'll build an Android app using FHIR Engine Library. Your app
will use FHIR Engine Library to download FHIR resources from a FHIR server, and
upload any local changes to the server.

### What you'll learn

*   How to create a local HAPI FHIR server using Docker
*   How to integrate FHIR Engine Library into your Android application
*   How to use the Sync API to set up a one-time or periodic job to download and
    upload FHIR resources
*   How to use the Search API
*   How to use the Data Access APIs to create, read, update, and delete FHIR
    resources locally

### What you'll need

*   Docker ([get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))
*   A recent version of
    [Android Studio (v4.1.2+)](https://developer.android.com/studio)
*   [Android Emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator) or a
    physical Android device running Android 7.0 Nougat or later
*   The sample code
*   Basic knowledge of Android development in Kotlin

If you haven't built Android apps before, you can start by
[building your first app](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp).

## Set up a local HAPI FHIR server with test data

[HAPI FHIR](https://hapifhir.io/hapi-fhir/) is a popular open source FHIR
server. We use a local HAPI FHIR server in our codelab for the Android app
to connect to.

### Set up the local HAPI FHIR server

1.  Run the following command in a terminal to get the latest image of HAPI FHIR
    ```shell
    docker pull hapiproject/hapi:latest
    ```

1.  Create a HAPI FHIR container by either using Docker Desktop to run the
    previously download image `hapiproject/hapi`, or running the following
    command
    ```shell
    docker run -p 8080:8080 hapiproject/hapi:latest
    ```
    Learn
    [more](https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter#running-via-docker-hub).

1.  Inspect the server by opening the URL `http://localhost:8080/` in a browser.
    You should see the HAPI FHIR web interface.

    ![HAPI FHIR web interface](images/image4.png "HAPI FHIR web interface")

### Populate the local HAPI FHIR server with test data

To test our application, we'll need some test data on the server. We'll use
synthetic data generated by Synthea.

1.  First, we need to download sample data from
    [synthea-samples](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea-sample-data/tree/master/downloads).
    Download and extract `synthea_sample_data_fhir_r4_sep2019.zip`. The
    un-zipped
    sample data has numerous `.json` files, each being a transaction bundle for
    an individual patient.

1.  We'll upload test data for three patients to the local HAPI FHIR server. Run
    the following command in the directory containing JSON files

    ```shell
    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @./Aaron697_Brekke496_2fa15bc7-8866-461a-9000-f739e425860a.json http://localhost:8080/fhir/
    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @./Aaron697_Stiedemann542_41166989-975d-4d17-b9de-17f94cb3eec1.json http://localhost:8080/fhir/
    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @./Abby752_Kuvalis369_2b083021-e93f-4991-bf49-fd4f20060ef8.json http://localhost:8080/fhir/
    ```

1.  To upload test data for all patients to the server, run

    ```shell
    for f in *.json; do curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @$f http://localhost:8080/fhir/ ; done
    ```

    However, this can take a long time to complete and is not necessary for the
    codelab.

1.  Verify that the test data is available on the server by opening the URL
    `http://localhost:8080/fhir/Patient/` in a browser. You should see the text
    `HTTP 200 OK` and the `Response Body` section of the page containing patient
    data in a FHIR Bundle as the search result with a `total` count.

    ![Test data on server](images/image5.png "Test data on server")

## Set up the Android app

### Download the Code

To download the code for this codelab, clone the Android FHIR SDK repository:
`git clone https://github.com/google/android-fhir.git`

The starter project for this codelab is located in `codelabs/engine`.

### Import the app into Android Studio

We start by importing the starter app into Android Studio.

Open Android Studio, select **Import Project (Gradle, Eclipse ADT, etc.)** and
choose the `codelabs/engine/` folder from the source code that you have
downloaded earlier.

![Android Studio start screen](images/image1.png "Android Studio start screen")

### Sync your project with Gradle files

For your convenience, the FHIR Engine Library dependencies have already been
added to the project. This allows you to integrate the FHIR Engine Library in
your app. Observe the following lines to the end of the `app/build.gradle.kts`
file of your project:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    // ...

    implementation("com.google.android.fhir:engine:0.1.0-beta05")
}
```

To be sure that all dependencies are available to your app, you should sync your
project with gradle files at this point.

Select **Sync Project with Gradle Files**
(![Gradle sync button](images/image3.png "Gradle sync button"))from the Android
Studio toolbar. You an also run the app again to check the dependencies are
working correctly.

### Run the starter app

Now that you have imported the project into Android Studio, you are ready to run
the app for the first time.

[Start the Android Studio emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator),
and click Run (![Run button](images/image2.png "Run button")) in the Android
Studio toolbar.

## Create FHIR Engine instance

To incorporate the FHIR Engine into your Android app, you'll need to use the
FHIR Engine Library and initiate an instance of the FHIR Engine. The steps
outlined below will guide you through the process.

1.  Navigate to your Application class, which in this example is
    `FhirApplication.kt`, located in
    `app/src/main/java/com/google/android/fhir/codelabs/engine`.
1.  Inside the `onCreate()` method, add the following code to initialize FHIR
    Engine:
    ```kotlin
      FhirEngineProvider.init(
          FhirEngineConfiguration(
            enableEncryptionIfSupported = true,
            RECREATE_AT_OPEN,
            ServerConfiguration(
              baseUrl = "http://10.0.2.2:8080/fhir/",
              httpLogger =
                HttpLogger(
                  HttpLogger.Configuration(
                    if (BuildConfig.DEBUG) HttpLogger.Level.BODY else HttpLogger.Level.BASIC,
                  ),
                ) {
                  Log.d("App-HttpLog", it)
                },
            ),
          ),
      )
    ```
    ---

    Notes:
    * `enableEncryptionIfSupported`: Enables data encryption if the device
      supports it.
    * `RECREATE_AT_OPEN`: Determines the database error strategy. In
      this case, it recreates the database if an error occurs upon opening.
    * `baseUrl` in ServerConfiguration: This is the FHIR server's base URL. The
      provided IP address `10.0.2.2` is specially reserved for localhost,
      accessible from the Android emulator. Learn
      [more](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-networking).

1.  In the `FhirApplication` class, add the following line to lazily instantiate
    the FHIR Engine: `kotlin private val fhirEngine: FhirEngine by lazy {
    FhirEngineProvider.getInstance(this) }` This ensures the FhirEngine instance
    is only created when it's accessed for the first time, not immediately when
    the app starts.

1.  Add the following convenience method in the `FhirApplication` class for
    easier access throughout your application:

    ```kotlin
    companion object {
        fun fhirEngine(context: Context) = (context.applicationContext as FhirApplication).fhirEngine
    }
    ```

    This static method lets you retrieve the FHIR Engine instance from anywhere
    in the app using the context.

## Sync data with FHIR server

1.  Create a new class `DownloadWorkManagerImpl.kt`. In this class, you'll
    define how the application fetches the next resource from the list to
    download.:
    ```kotlin
    class DownloadWorkManagerImpl : DownloadWorkManager {
      private val urls = LinkedList(listOf("Patient"))

      override suspend fun getNextRequest(): DownloadRequest? {
        val url = urls.poll() ?: return null
        return DownloadRequest.of(url)
      }

      override suspend fun getSummaryRequestUrls() = mapOf<ResourceType, String>()

      override suspend fun processResponse(response: Resource): Collection<Resource> {
        var bundleCollection: Collection<Resource> = mutableListOf()
        if (response is Bundle && response.type == Bundle.BundleType.SEARCHSET) {
          bundleCollection = response.entry.map { it.resource }
        }
        return bundleCollection
      }
    }
    ```

    This class has a queue of resource types it wants to download. It processes
    responses and extracts the resources from the returned bundle, which get
    saved into the local database.

1.  Create a new class `AppFhirSyncWorker.kt` This class defines how the app
    will sync with the remote FHIR server using a background worker.

    ```kotlin
    class AppFhirSyncWorker(appContext: Context, workerParams: WorkerParameters) :
      FhirSyncWorker(appContext, workerParams) {

      override fun getDownloadWorkManager() = DownloadWorkManagerImpl()

      override fun getConflictResolver() = AcceptLocalConflictResolver

      override fun getFhirEngine() = FhirApplication.fhirEngine(applicationContext)
    }
    ```

    Here, we've defined which download manager, conflict resolver, and FHIR
    engine instance to use for syncing.

1.  In your ViewModel, `PatientListViewModel.kt`, you'll set up a one-time sync
    mechanism. Locate and add this code to the `triggerOneTimeSync()` function:

    ```kotlin
    viewModelScope.launch {
      Sync.oneTimeSync<AppFhirSyncWorker>(getApplication())
        .shareIn(this, SharingStarted.Eagerly, 10)
        .collect { _pollState.emit(it) }
    }
    ```

    This coroutine initiates a one-time sync with the FHIR server using the
    AppFhirSyncWorker we defined earlier. It will then update the UI based on
    the state of the sync process.

1.  In the `PatientListFragment.kt` file, update the body of the
    `handleSyncJobStatus` function:

    ```kotlin
    when (syncJobStatus) {
      is SyncJobStatus.Finished -> {
        Toast.makeText(requireContext(), "Sync Finished", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
        viewModel.searchPatientsByName("")
      }
      else -> {}
    }
    ```

    Here, when the sync process finishes, a toast message will display notifying
    the user, and the app will then display all patients by invoking a search
    with an empty name.

Now that everything is set up, run your app. Click the `Sync` button in the
menu. If everything works correctly, you should see the patients from your local
FHIR server being downloaded and displayed in the application.

## Modify and Upload Patient Data

In this section, we will guide you through the process of modifying patient data
based on specific criteria and uploading the updated data to your FHIR server.
Specifically, we will swap the address cities for patients residing in
`Wakefield` and `Taunton`.

### **Step 1**: Set Up the modification logic in PatientListViewModel

The code in this section is added to the `triggerUpdate` function in
`PatientListViewModel`

1.  **Access the FHIR Engine**:

    Start by getting a reference to the FHIR engine in the
    `PatientListViewModel.kt`.

    ```kotlin
    viewModelScope.launch {
       val fhirEngine = FhirApplication.fhirEngine(getApplication())
    ```

    This code launches a coroutine within the ViewModel's scope and initializes
    the FHIR engine.

1.  **Search for Patients from Wakefield**:

    Use the FHIR engine to search for patients with an address city of
    `Wakefield`.

    ```kotlin
    val patientsFromWakefield =
         fhirEngine.search<Patient> {
           filter(
             Patient.ADDRESS_CITY,
             {
               modifier =  StringFilterModifier.MATCHES_EXACTLY
               value = "Wakefield"
             }
           )
         }
    ```

    Here, we are using the FHIR engine's `search` method to filter patients
    based on their address city. The result will be a list of patients from
    Wakefield.

1.  **Search for Patients from Taunton**:

    Similarly, search for patients with an address city of `Taunton`.

    ```kotlin
    val patientsFromTaunton =
         fhirEngine.search<Patient> {
           filter(
             Patient.ADDRESS_CITY,
             {
               modifier =  StringFilterModifier.MATCHES_EXACTLY
               value = "Taunton"
             }
           )
         }
    ```

    We now have two lists of patients - one from Wakefield and the other from
    Taunton.

1.  **Modify Patient Addresses**:

    Go through each patient in the `patientsFromWakefield` list, change their
    city to `Taunton`, and update them in the FHIR engine.

    ```kotlin
    patientsFromWakefield.forEach {
         it.resource.address.first().city = "Taunton"
         fhirEngine.update(it.resource)
    }
    ```

    Similarly, update each patient in the `patientsFromTaunton` list to have
    their city changed to `Wakefield`.

    ```kotlin
    patientsFromTaunton.forEach {
         it.resource.address.first().city = "Wakefield"
         fhirEngine.update(it.resource)
    }
    ```

1.  **Initiate Synchronization**:

    After modifying the data locally, trigger a one-time sync to ensure the data
    is updated on the FHIR server.

    ```kotlin
    triggerOneTimeSync()
    ```

    The closing brace `}` signifies the end of the coroutine launched at the
    beginning.

### **Step 2**: Test the Functionality

1.  **UI Testing**:

    Run your app. Click the `Update` button in the menu. You should see the
    address cities for patient `Aaron697` and `Abby752` swapped.

1.  **Server Verification**:

    Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/fhir/Patient/`. Verify
    that the address city for patients `Aaron697` and `Abby752` is updated on
    the local FHIR server.

By following these steps, you've successfully implemented a mechanism to modify
patient data and synchronize the changes with your FHIR server.

## Search for Patients by Name

Searching for patients by their names can provide a user-friendly way of
retrieving information. Here, we'll walk you through the process of implementing
this feature in your application.

### **Step 1**: Update the Function Signature

Navigate to your `PatientListViewModel.kt` file and find the function named
`searchPatientsByName`. We will be adding code into this function.

To filter the results based on the provided name query, incorporate the
following conditional code block:

```kotlin
viewModelScope.launch {
  val fhirEngine = FhirApplication.fhirEngine(getApplication())
  if (nameQuery.isNotEmpty()) {
    fhirEngine.search<Patient> {
      filter(
        Patient.NAME,
        {
          modifier = StringFilterModifier.CONTAINS
          value = nameQuery
        },
      )
    }
  }
}
```

Here, if the `nameQuery` is not empty, the search function will filter the
results to only include patients whose names contain the specified query.

### **Step 2**: Test the New Search Functionality

1.  **Relaunch the App**:

    After making these changes, rebuild and run your app.

1.  **Search for Patients**: On the patient list screen, use the search
    functionality. You should now be able to enter a name (or part of a name) to
    filter the list of patients accordingly.

With these steps completed, you've enhanced your application by providing users
with the ability to efficiently search for patients by their names. This can
significantly improve user experience and efficiency in data retrieval.
