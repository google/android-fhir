# Git Tips

This page documents [Git](https://git-scm.com) tips for contributors to this project.

This project generally follows [these guidelines](https://github.com/google/fhir-data-pipes/blob/master/doc/review_process.md) from our `fhir-data-pipes` sister project.

## Overview

We use the following workflow:

1. Contributors can open "draft" PRs for any Work In Progress (WIP) which does not require review yet.
   It's OK if the checks do not pass yet.

1. When a PR is ready for code review, the contributor marks the PR as "Ready for review". For a smooth review, the PR must pass all the checks.
   At this point, the PR should only have 1 single commit; please "squash" (or use `--amend`) your "local history",
   before pushing to a branch to open a PR (or when your WIP Draft PR is ready for review). The commit message
   of this initial commit should explain what this PR is all about.

1. Maintainers, or other Contributors, will now review the PR. They may add comments requesting changes.

1. When contributors update PRs to make changes requested by reviewers, those should be added as
   additional new single commits per round of review,
   typically with a generic message such as _"Incorporated review feedback."_
   Do NOT squash (or amend) these review updates into the original commit.

1. Maintainers (with write acces) _squash_ all commits of PRs into a single commit when merging.

## Usage

### Edit on GitHub Web UI

To make simple single file changes, notably e.g. to `docs/*.md` Markdown files,
it can be convenient to simply click the _"Pencil" button_ on GitHub's Web UI
to _Edit in place._ For a more fully fledged IDE for docs, see [Docs](docs.md).

### Locally with Git CLI

Using the standard `git` CLI client, you would typically do the following:

1. Initially, one time only, click Fork on https://github.com/google/android-fhir/tree/master and:

       git clone git@github.com:google/android-fhir.git
       cd android-fhir
       git remote add YOUR-UID git@github.com:YOUR-UID/android-fhir.git

2. Now every time you want to propose a change, you do:

       git checkout -b NEW-BRANCH-NAME
       ... do some work ...
       git commit -a -m "MESSAGE ABOUT WHAT YOU CHANGED"
       git push YOUR-UID

   This will print something with a URL you can click on to create a Pull Request.

3. To _"rebase"_ your local branch so that it has the latest upstream work:

       git checkout master
       git pull
       git checkout THAT-BRANCH-NAME
       git rebase master

4. When you get code review feedback and would like to make some changes:

       git checkout THAT-BRANCH-NAME
       ... do some work ...
       git commit -a -m "Incorporated review feedback."
       git push --force-with-lease YOUR-UID

Note that, as per [these guidelines](https://github.com/google/fhir-data-pipes/blob/master/doc/review_process.md) we do not `commit --amend`. (Maintainers will _"squash"_ when merging PRs.)

### Locally with GitHub's CLI

https://cli.github.com is a GitHub specific tool which allows you to do certain
operations from the CLI instead of having to click on the GitHub Web UI, e.g. :

    gh repo fork google/android-fhir --clone --remote

    gh pr create

    gh pr checkout 2306

https://github.com/topics/gh-extension has a lot of fancy extensions for `gh`.

`gh` is also useful to manage GitHub Secrets.
