# Dev Containers for GitHub Codespaces

This project includes (initial) support for
[GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview), based on
[Development Containers](https://containers.dev) technology.

**Status:** This is currently primarily used as a ready-made environment
for documentation writing for this project. The Gradle build also works.
However support for Kotlin development for Android is TBD.
Your contributions to make this better are very welcome.

## Usage

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/google/android-fhir?quickstart=1)

If you are missing your fancy custom Shell configuration that you have built over the last 100 years,
you should [set up your dotfiles for Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-your-user-preferences/personalizing-github-codespaces-for-your-account#dotfiles)
such as [e.g. this dude did in his dotfiles](https://github.com/vorburger/vorburger-dotfiles-bin-etc#github-codespaces).
