The Android FHIR SDK is a set of Kotlin libraries for building offline-capable, mobile-first
healthcare applications using the [HL7速 FHIR速 standard](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/) on Android. It
aims to accelerate the adoption of FHIR by making it easy to incorporate FHIR into new and existing
mobile applications.
