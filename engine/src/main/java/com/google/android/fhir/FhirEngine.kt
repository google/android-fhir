/**
 * Provides an interface for managing FHIR resources in local storage.
 *
 * The FHIR Engine allows you to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) FHIR resources, as well as
 * perform searches and synchronize data with a remote FHIR server. The FHIR resources are
 * represented using HAPI FHIR Structures [Resource] and [ResourceType].
 *
 * To use a FHIR Engine instance, first call [FhirEngineProvider.init] with a
 * [FhirEngineConfiguration]. This must be done only once; we recommend doing this in the
 * `onCreate()` function of your `Application` class.
 *
 * ```
 * class MyApplication : Application() {
 *   override fun onCreate() {
 *     super.onCreate()
 *
 *     FhirEngineProvider.init(
 *       FhirEngineConfiguration(
 *         enableEncryptionIfSupported = true,
 *         RECREATE_AT_OPEN
 *       )
 *     )
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * To get a `FhirEngine` to interact with, use [FhirEngineProvider.getInstance]:
 * ```
 * val fhirEngine = FhirEngineProvider.getInstance(this)
 * ```
