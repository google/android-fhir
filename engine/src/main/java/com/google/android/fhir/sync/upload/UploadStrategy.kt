/**
 * Defines strategies for uploading FHIR resource
 * [local changes][com.google.android.fhir.LocalChange] to a server during synchronization. It is
 * used by the [FhirSyncWorker][com.google.android.fhir.sync.FhirSyncWorker] to determine the
 * specific upload behavior.
 *
 * To specify an upload strategy, override
 * [getUploadStrategy][com.google.android.fhir.sync.FhirSyncWorker.getUploadStrategy] in your app's
 * [FhirSyncWorker][com.google.android.fhir.sync.FhirSyncWorker], for example:
 * ```
 * override fun getUploadStrategy(): UploadStrategy = UploadStrategy.AllChangesSquashedBundlePut
 * ```
 *
 * The strategy you select depends on the server's capabilities (for example, support for `PUT` vs
 * `POST` requests), and your business requirements (for example, maintaining the history of every
 * local change).
 *
 * Each strategy specifies three key aspects of the upload process:
 * * **Fetching local changes**: This determines which local changes are included in the upload,
 *   specified by the [localChangesFetchMode] property.
 * * **Generating patches**: This determines how the local changes are represented for upload,
 *   specified by the [patchGeneratorMode] property.
 * * **Creating upload requests**: This determines how the patches are packaged and sent to the
 *   server, specified by the [requestGeneratorMode] property.
 *
 * Note: The strategies listed here represent all currently supported combinations of local change
 * fetching, patch generation, and upload request creation. Not all possible combinations of these
 * modes are valid or supported.
