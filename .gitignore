# MkDocs Documentation Generation
# Note: The docs/ directory is our SOURCE (in MD),
# and the site/ directory is our TARGET (in HTML)
site/
# but the Dokka API Doc is generated into docs/
# (which is slightly confusing, but helps mkdocs to validate links)
# so we ignore that here, as it's a built artifact that should not be committed
